### 📌 **Subject:** Full-Stack Application Review, Testing, and Feature Enhancements
---
### **Request Overview**
I would like a complete analysis, testing, and enhancement of our project's frontend and backend components. The tasks include end-to-end testing of key features, UI/UX improvements, redirection handling, profile and data consistency checks, third-party authentication integration, and performance optimization.
---
### ✅ **Detailed Scope of Work**
#### **1. Full Stack Analysis**
* Perform a **complete review of both frontend and backend** architectures.
* Identify inconsistencies, broken flows, and optimization opportunities.
#### **2. Authentication & Registration Testing**
* Test and validate the following:
  * Recruiter login and registration
  * Applicant login and registration
  #### **3. Job Post Management**
* Test the **Job Posting Form** for:
  * Adding new job posts
  * Updating existing posts
  * Deleting posts
* Ensure that these changes **reflect correctly**:
  * On the Job Listings page
  * On the Recruiter's Dashboard or Profile Page
  #### **4. Notifications & Dashboard Integration**
* Test if all alerts, notifications, and settings:
  * Display correctly on the **dashboard for both Recruiters and Applicants**
  * Update dynamically based on actions taken
  #### **5. Profile Management**
* Test Recruiter and Applicant **Profile Update & Deletion**
* Verify that changes are:
  * Persisted to the backend
  * Reflected correctly in the frontend UI
  #### **6. Redirection and Navigation Testing**
* Verify all redirections:
  * Register ➝ Login
  * Login ➝ Appropriate Dashboard
  * View Company Details ➝ External Company Website
  * View Job Details ➝ Pop-up with job info
  * Apply for Job ➝ Dashboard or confirmation page
  * Handle **any other redirection or navigation flows**
* Create and beautify **missing pages**, and ensure broken links are resolved
#### **7. Frontend-Backend Integration Validation**
* Confirm that all frontend actions:
  * Are handled properly by the backend
  * Return appropriate success/error responses
  * Display accurate data from the backend
  #### **8. Load Handling**
* Simulate and test the application with **increased incoming requests** to ensure:
  * Stability
  * Performance
  * No data inconsistencies
  #### **9. Full Regression Testing**
* After all tasks above are completed:
  * Perform a **full test cycle twice** to ensure stability and consistency
  #### **10. OAuth Integration**
* Integrate and test **social authentication** using:
  * Google
  * Microsoft
  * Apple
* Ensure each flow:
  * Retrieves and stores all essential user data (name, email, etc.)
  * Works seamlessly across devices

### 🎯 **Deliverables**
* Functional and bug-free full-stack application
* Clean and user-friendly redirection flow
* Working third-party authentication
* Clear report of all tests performed and issues resolved
